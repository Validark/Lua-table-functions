# Lua-table-functions
Pure-lua implementations of table functions. This is useful for earlier versions of Lua which wish to use the newer functions. For example, Lua 5.1 does not ship with `table.pack` or `table.move` by default. In LuaJIT, one can simply write these functions into `table` and use them as you normally would!
